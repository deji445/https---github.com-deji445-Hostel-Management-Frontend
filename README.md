###---How to run locally-----

#---how to start the backend----

--since you have acces to the github repo

1-clone or open the the folder on your local machine
-git clone <Hostel-management-Backend>

 you can also change the "DATABASE_URL" and use your own postgres (all sql query's are stated in sql code.txt) 

3-to start the server- npm run dev  


#---how to start the frontend----
1-clone or install in a separate terminal 
run---http-server . -p 8080

---in app.js you have to set it to
const API_BASE = 'http://localhost:5000/api';

after running: http-server . -p 8080 you would see to servers select the second one 
( http://127.0.0.1:8080)

and everything should work, hopefully.
